# Color-Switch
A replica of a famous game named Color Switch. 
## Implementation

➔ We implemented the game using FXML using buttons, labels and text
boxes.

➔ Every player has to enter his/her name before starting the game.

➔ The ball bounces by clicking the space key and to pause the game,
there is a button on the left side of the screen.

➔ A color switcher will appear periodically to change the color of the ball.
High score is recorded after every game.

The UML diagram shows the idiations and flow of how the code is implemented.

The colorSwitch_final contains the working game code with all the png images used.

Main.java contains the code and frontend of the initial main page of the game along with the obstacle designs.

The main page is as follows:
